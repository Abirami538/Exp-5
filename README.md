# Exp - 5 STUDENT ENROLLMENT SYSTEM

# AIM:
  Draw the UML diagram for STUDENT ENROLLMENT SYSTEM.
  
# SRS (Procedure):



1.Use Case Diagram:
Shows how users (actors) interact with the system and represents main functions like Login, Register, and Apply for Job.

2.Class Diagram:
Displays the system’s structure using classes, attributes, and methods, showing relationships like inheritance and association.

3.Activity Diagram:
Represents the flow of activities or processes in the system, explaining how operations proceed step by step.

4.Communication Diagram:
Illustrates how different objects exchange messages and interact to complete tasks within the system.

5.Package Diagram:
Groups related classes or modules into packages to organize the system and reduce complexity.

6.Sequence Diagram:
Shows the sequence of interactions between objects over time, explaining how processes occur in a specific order.
